# Scotiabank-Stocks-Graph
This repo is used to host my Scotiabank stocks graph. Using Python, Pandas, and Bokeh, I process data from Yahoo Finance and present it on a candlestick chart. The graph I created shows daily stock data from January 1995 to the present.

The chart can be viewed at https://scotiabank-stock.herokuapp.com/.

## Acknowledgments
I developed this project to explore the relationship between technology and finance.

I chose to specifically plot Scotiabank Toronto's data because during my stock market research I found that it is an excellent long-term core holding. Also, Scotiabank is Canada's most international bank, which makes it all the more interesting to follow and study.
