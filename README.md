# Candlestick-Graphs
This repo is used to host my live candlestick stocks graph. Using Python, Pandas, and Bokeh, I process data from Yahoo Finance and present it on a candlestick chart. The graphs created show daily stock data from the day the company debuted on the stock market to the present.

The chart can be viewed at https://candlestick-stocks.herokuapp.com/.

## Acknowledgments
I developed this project to explore the relationship between technology and finance.

Originally, this web app only plotted Scotiabank Toronto's data because during my stock market research I found that it is an excellent long-term core holding. However, I realized that it's more beneficial to be able to view the stock data of ANY company instead of just one.
